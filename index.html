			<h2>My Skills & Hobbies</h2>
			
			<p>Some skills and hobbies I have are javascript and html/css coding, karate, and working with computer programs. I spend a lot of my time eating, making slime, online, and doing creative activities.</p>
		 	
			 <p>I like making slime, and doing art activities. I am in karate and I spend about 3 hours there twice a week so 6 hours per week. I like to go to the beach, park, movies, desert, etc. My grandparents have a cabin in Johnson Valley, so I do a lot of dirt-bike riding, and camping in that area. </p>
			
			<p>I started reading to dogs, over winter break last year, and I love doing it. It's one of my favorite things to do, because you know that these animals don't get a lot of direct attention and it's such a wonderful feeling. The reading calms them down, and they just sit there and listen to you. I volunteer at the Long Beach Animal Shelter. </p>

			<h2>My Family</h2>
			
			<p>I live with my mom, dad, older brother and dog. My brother isn't home a lot, but my mom and dad are home most of the time so I'm not usually alone. </p>
			
			<p>I couldn't wish for a better family. My uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents are so supporting and I don't know where I would be without them.</p>
		
			<p>My brother constantly has friends or his girlfriend over, my mom is home most of the time, and my dad works during the day, but he is home on the weekends. I have a dog named Max and I spend A LOT of my time at my cousin's house.</p>
