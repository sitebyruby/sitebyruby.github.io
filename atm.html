		<h2>6th Grade Learning</h2>	
			<p>In the 6th grade we learned different programs and lessons about computers and technology in general. For example, we worked on programs like word and excel. We also learned different lessons and skills like typing, internet safety and javascript coding.</p>
			
		<h2>7th Grade Learning</h2>
			<p>In 7th grade, our year was split in two, with different teachers for both sections. In the first semester we learned on programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator, we also practiced photography. In the second semester we learned on programs like Sketchup and Floorplanner.</p>
			<p>Once website we used in 7th and 8th grade is Khan Academy</p>
			<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>
			
		<h2>8th Grade Learning</h2>	
			<p>In 8th grade, we have learned on iMovie and Garageband, html and css coding, and movie shots.
			 I am really excited to work with more programs after this semester. </p>
			
		<h2>Overall Reflection of ATM</h2>
			<p>I am so glad that I took and have been taking ATM for my elective during middle school. It has taught me amazing skills that will be very helpful in the future, like typing, coding, and using microsoft programs. I know that this will be helpful in the future when I am working on important assignments in school or even work. These skills will last me forever and I am so grateful that I have had this opportunity. I have made friends in this program and learned so much than I would have in any other program about computers at this school. </p>
