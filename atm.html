		<h2>6th Grade Learning</h2>	
			<p>In the 6th grade we learned different programs and lessons about computers and technology in general. For example, we worked on programs like word and excel. We also learned different lessons and skills like typing, internet safety and javascript coding.</p>
			
		<h2>7th Grade Learning</h2>
			<p>In 7th grade, our year was split in two, with different teachers for both sections. In the first semester we learned on programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator, we also practiced photography. In the second semester we learned on programs like Sketchup and Floorplanner.</p>
			
			
		<h2>8th Grade Learning</h2>	
			<p>In 8th grade, we have learned on iMovie and Garageband, html and css coding, and movie shots.
			 I am really excited to work with more programs after this semester. </p>
