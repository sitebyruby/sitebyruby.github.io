			<h2>Self Defense</h2>
				<p>Karate is a huge part of my life, and has been for almost 6 years now. I train at Z Ultimate Self Defense studios in Long Beach, and it has changed my life. I have made friends that will last a lifetime, and gained mentors that I can look up to, and talk to whenever I need them. It has been the best years of my life.</p>
				
				<p>It's amazing to think that some people may not even see the point to learning self defense, but it could save a life, even several lives, and it will. If you know self defense, and you're in a difficult situation, it can help you get out of it. It also helps you learn manners and discipline. </p>
				
				<p>I admit, karate isn't for everyone, and some people think that it's just for kids, to get interested in something when they are young, and then move on to a different sport. I don't feel this way though. I think that people should join karate and learn self defense because it is so helpful to know. I don't know how to explain how much it has affected my life. I have a family there, and so many different oppourtunities. For example one day, when I have a work permit, I could have a part time job there.	</p>
